Proposal

### What problem does your app solve?

* Servers are not getting their fair share of the tips they earn from customers. 

### Be as specific as possible; how does your app solve the problem?
* Allows 100% of tips to go directly to the server of choice instead of being split up amongst other employees/staff. 
### What is the mission statement?
* TipEase: Serving the Servers 
* OR
* TipEase: We Serve Servers 
Features

### What features are required for your minimum viable product?
* Functioning Log in page
* Navigation on all pages 
* Home Page 
* List of possible Servers 
* Marketing Page (About Us)
* Service Worker Page
* Profile for individual service worker  


### What features may you wish to put in a future release?


### What do the top 3 similar apps do for their users?


## Design - Planning

Optional but highly recommended Please refer to this document:
Build Weeks: Planning & Design Worksheet (How to build a beautiful application)
What design system will you use?


### What will your user flow be?


### What is the URL to your wireframes?


## Frameworks - Libraries

### What 3rd party frameworks/libraries are you considering using?
* Redux
* React
* Styled Component 


### Do APIs require you to contact its maintainer to gain access?
No
### Are you required to pay to use the API?
No
### Have you considered using Apple Frameworks? (MapKit, Healthkit, ARKit?)


## For Data Scientists

### Describe the Established data source with at least rough data able to be provided on day 1.


### You can gather information about the data set you’ll be working with from the project description. Be sure to collaborate with your PM, and your Backend Architect to chat about the resources you have.


### Write a description for what the DS problem is (what uncertainty/prediction are we trying to do here? Sentiment analysis? Why is this a useful solution to a problem?)


### A target (e.g. JSON format or such) for output that DS students can deliver to web/other students for them to ingest and use in the app


## Target Audience

### Who is your target audience? Be specific.
* Servers and their customers 
### What feedback have you gotten from potential users?
* “Its amazing and convenient”
-Kayla  


## Have you validated the problem and your solution with your target audience? How?

* TBD

## Research

Research thoroughly before writing a single line of code. Solidify the features of your app conceptually before implementation. Spend the weekend researching so you can hit the ground running on Monday.
Prototype Key Feature(s)

This is the “bread and butter” of the app, this is what makes your app yours. Calculate how long it takes to implement these features and triple the time estimated. That way you’ll have plenty of time to finish. It is preferred to drop features and spend more time working on your MVP features if needed.
